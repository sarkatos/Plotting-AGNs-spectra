# Plotting-AGNs-spectra
The main objective is to create a code to read files in .fits format and create a graph of its spectrum, the focus will be on studying AGN's while the code should work for any type of galaxy.  This is a work in progress that is in its early stages. Further automation is in the 'to do' list.
